        <p class="p1"> For the past five years, I have been teaching a science, math, and robotics to students in grades K-8. One of my great passions is teaching English to adults, which presents the challenge of analyzing linguistic syntax and solving lexical puzzles in a people-oriented environment. I believe that my love of learning, algebraic thinking, and linguistics have led to my zeal for web development. By the end of my coursework at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I will be a Full Stack Web Developer. I am driven and excited to further my work in the field of technology.
